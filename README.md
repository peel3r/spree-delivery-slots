==================

[SpreeDeliverySlots](https://github.com/peel3r/spree-delivery-slots) allows customer to select preferred delivery time for his order. Admin can add a number of time slots(ex: 11:00 AM - 3 PM and 4 PM - 9PM) when he can deliver from shipping method edit/new page. Customer will be able to select only from these pre-created time slots.



Add spree_delivery_slots to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_delivery_slots', git: 'https://github.com/peel3r/spree-delivery-slots'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_delivery_slots:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rspec spec
```
